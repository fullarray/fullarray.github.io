I started as a programmer and scripter(computer bash/batch), and I built my way up through complex systems, programming languages, and operating systems. I developed these skills as a side job. I disliked getting roadblocks that prevented me from trying new technology or completing my work. I am a long time programmer analyst because I like the work and enjoy rolling up my sleeves to simplify repetitive tasks, build computer, mobile, &amp;amp; web applications, and enhance system workflows(e.g. CRM). The title “programmer” have many synonyms today. Synonyms that sometimes confuse leadership and management. For instance, I held titles of software engineer, systems analyst, developer, etc. This ambiguity makes it challenging to write serious resumes. I find it challenging to express cohesiveness on my resume, as having different titles might throw off less technical people such as recruiters or startups founders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my spare time, I like to read, play guitar, drive by A1A(sort of like “beach hwy” here in Florida), and hypothesize on real world problems and their possible solutions. You can get in touch with me via Github.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Fullarray</name></author><category term="general update" /><summary type="html">I’m a technologist, computer scientist, and imagineer at my core.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
